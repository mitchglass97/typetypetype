# typetypetype

*typetypetype* is a simple typing speed test web app. It keeps running stats of WPM, Accuracy, and Mistakes. Each time a correct letter is typed, that letter turns white and fades away. If an incorrect character is typed, the  character on-screen is highlighted red. There are also fun sound effects that I stole from iPhone.
